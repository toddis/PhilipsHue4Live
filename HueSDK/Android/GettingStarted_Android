1. To get started programming with the Hue Android SDK, download the release.
2. In your Android Studio project, choose "File->New->New Module..." and select "Import .JAR/.AAR Package". There, select "Android/huesdk.aar" file and click Finish.
3. In the settings.gradle file, add 'huesdk' project:
    include ':app', ':huesdk'

4. In the gradle file of your module, add the following dependency:
    dependencies {
        ... other dependencies here ...
        compile project(':huesdk')
    }

5. Load the huesdk library in your main activity class:

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("huesdk");
    }

    ...
}

You'll also need the INTERNET permission in your app's manifest in order to communicate with the Hue bridge.

Follow the Java API Guide which explains the general principles and contains Java code examples.
